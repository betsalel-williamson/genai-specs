# Operational Protocols

Universal protocols for LLM-assisted development that apply to any software project.

## Communication Standards

- **Use Plain, Literal Language**
  Communicate with precision. Avoid ambiguity, jargon, and figurative language.
- **Maintain a Coaching Tone**
  Advise as one senior peer to another. The goal is collaborative improvement, not dictation.
- **Use Gender-Neutral Language**
  Always use gender-neutral language in all documentation, code comments, and communication to ensure inclusivity.

## AI-Generated Code Responsibility

When generating code with LLMs:

- **Understand What You Generate**
  Don't accept or commit code you don't understand. Review and comprehend AI-generated logic.
- **Validate Correctness**
  AI can produce plausible but incorrect code. Verify logic, edge cases, and assumptions.
- **Test Comprehensively**
  AI-generated code needs thorough test coverage to catch subtle bugs.

## Code Modification Principles

- **Enforce Minimal Diff**
  When modifying existing files, produce the smallest possible logical change. Don't reformat code or make unrelated changes in the same step.
- **Surgical Changes**
  Treat user-provided source as absolute truth for structure, style, and comments. Apply only necessary changes.
- **Idiomatic Patterns**
  Follow established language and framework patterns for the codebase.
