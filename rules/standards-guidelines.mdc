# Guidelines Standards

Standards for creating and maintaining guideline documents.

This document defines the format for "lessons learned" entries. Each lesson is a standalone Markdown file in `genai-specs/guidelines/<category>/`.

## File Naming

Use `kebab-case` for filenames, for example, `topic-of-lesson.md`.

## Content Structure

Each lesson should follow this structure:

### Title

Concise summary of the lesson.

### Problem

Briefly describe the issue encountered.

### Solution

Briefly explain how the issue was resolved.

### Impact

Why was this lesson important? (for example, prevented future bugs, saved time).

### Takeaways

Actionable insights or generalizable principles.

## Best Practices for Guidelines

* **Clarity:** Use simple language.
* **Conciseness:** Get straight to the point.
* **Actionable:** Provide clear steps or advice.
* **Relevance:** Focus on practical, recurring issues.
* **Consistency:** Adhere to this format.
