# Architecture Decision Record (ADR) Standards

ADRs capture single architectural decisions with context, options, and consequences as historical logs.

## ADR Structure

All ADRs must include:

### Context

Describe the forces at play including technical, political, and project concerns. What problem are we solving? What are the constraints?

### Decision

State the decision clearly and concisely. This is the core of the ADR.

### Alternatives Considered

List and briefly describe alternatives that were considered. For each alternative, explain why it was not chosen.

### Consequences

Describe positive and negative consequences of the decision. What are the implications for the system, team, and future development?

### Rationale

Explain *why* this decision was made, referencing the context and consequences. This is the justification for the chosen solution.

### Status

Current status: proposed, accepted, superseded, or deprecated.

### References

Links to related documents, design specs, other ADRs, or external resources.

## ADR Principles

- **Single Decision Focus**: Each ADR addresses one architectural decision
- **Historical Record**: Maintain chronological log of decisions
- **Context Preservation**: Capture the situation that led to the decision
- **Consequence Awareness**: Document both positive and negative outcomes
- **Traceability**: Link to related decisions and documents

## Document Creation and Storage

New Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) should be created by copying this `standards-decision.md` file as a template.

**Storage Location and Naming:**

- All ADRs should be stored within the `docs/decisions/` directory.
- **Filenames** should follow a numerical prefix and descriptive `kebab-case` format (e.g., `0001-choose-database-technology.md`, `0002-implement-authentication-strategy.md`). This ensures chronological ordering and easy identification.

This structure ensures that ADRs are organized logically, are easily discoverable, and provide a clear historical log of decisions.
