# Deprecation Warnings Handling

## Problem

When encountering deprecation warnings during development, it's tempting to simply remove the deprecated functionality or make assumptions about the replacement API without proper research. This leads to:

- Incorrect API usage and compilation/runtime errors
- Loss of functionality on older platform versions
- Continued deprecation warnings
- Security vulnerabilities from outdated APIs
- Performance degradation from deprecated implementations
- Technical debt accumulation

## Solution

Follow this systematic approach when encountering deprecation warnings:

1. **Research the exact replacement** - Check official documentation, compiler error messages, IDE suggestions, migration guides, and community discussions
2. **Implement proper version compatibility** - Use modern APIs directly for modern-only projects, or appropriate compatibility checks for multi-version support
3. **Test thoroughly** - Run tests, verify functionality, check for new warnings, test edge cases, and validate performance
4. **Document the change** - Add comments, update tests, create ADRs for significant changes, and add migration notes

## Impact

This approach prevents incorrect API usage, maintains functionality across platform versions, eliminates deprecation warnings, improves security by using current APIs, prevents performance issues, and reduces technical debt.

## Takeaways

- Never ignore deprecation warnings - they indicate APIs that will be removed
- Always research the exact replacement - don't guess or assume
- Use appropriate version compatibility checks - maintain backward compatibility when needed
- Test thoroughly - ensure warnings are actually resolved
- Don't just remove deprecated functionality - update it properly
- Document changes - help future developers understand the decisions
- Consider security implications - deprecated APIs may have vulnerabilities
- Plan migration timelines - deprecation warnings often have removal deadlines
